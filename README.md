# Readme

This is an assignment from React, Javascript Course, the Odin Project.
[Project Description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card)
[Live site](https://sawfiz.github.io/memory-card-app/)

## What I learned
- Use `useRef` to store variables that does not change over rerenders
  - This was used when I was randomly generating colors for each game.  I need the random colors to remain the same over each game.
  - I no longer need to use it as I used images in the cards, instead of colors.
- Adding a modal in React
- Deploying a React app into Github Pages
